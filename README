The primary goals of Project Benzene are to: 
-provide an alternative to the PHP based tracker frontends such as TBDev and Gazelle, 
-utilize a MVC framework to create a more organized and modular tracker platform, 
-establish a platform for users to share modules (apps) that they write, and promote collaboration on addition to the codebase, 
-remain easy for users to install and modify, but not at the sake of performance
