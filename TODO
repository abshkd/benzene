Things to do to complete Userbase:

-put links on the login and register pages back to the home page
-create top bar with navigation and user info (profile stuff)
-create template for individual user pages (shows info about user)
-create template and finish form code for "Edit Profile" page
-add a "startup" script that makes an initial user and makes them staff
-template the staff page
-implement either tastypie or piston as API
-caching...
-documentation (We will not continue onto another app until userbase is sufficiently documented)
-finalize protocol for userbase interacting with other apps data (the problem of showing the # of forum posts on profile page)
